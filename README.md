- 👋 Hi, I’m @methanius, Claus N. Wibrand, a quantum optics physicist by training and research scientist in digital signals processing by trade
- 👀 I’m passionate about the intersection of applied math, software and hardware.  Recently, theoretical computer science has fascinated me as well.
- 🛠 Paid to write simulations, data exploration, fast algorithms, hardware integration and tooling like CLIs and remote control APIs.
- 👶 Tired and happy father of a boy of 6 months.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and the functional and type-level approaches to data modelling, partially by also playing with Haskell, a lot by reading books and too little by programming right now due to 👶.
- 🔬 Published author of 1! scientific articles:
  *  <https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.104.052621> (or on arxiv under the same title)\
     The article involved learning Itô calculus, spending too much time optimizing my initial Python code and subsequently learning and transitioning to C++ for huge performance gains.
- 📫 I'm reachable here, on LinkedIn by my given name and WhatsApp and messenger for my friends and family!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
