- 👋 Hi, I’m @methanius, Claus N. Wibrand, a quantum physicist by training and research scientist in digital signals processing by trade
- 👀 I’m passionate about the intersection of applied math, software and hardware, finding great joy in modeling the world with increasing precision, using and writing software tools and code that runs fast as hell! Recently, theoretical computer science has fascinated me as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust and the functional and type-level approaches to data modelling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HPC or fast and efficient tooling
- 📫 How to reach me ...
